\section{Introduction}
Um, something happened here.


\section{STL Allocators}
The Binary Buddy memory allocator is unsuitable as a general purpose STL
allocators since it does not maintain the memory interface for all STL
containers. For example the STL vector guarantees that the successive items in
the vector will be stored contiguously in memory. In a sense, raw pointers are
permitted to access a vector, since the binary buddy does not make this
guarantee, it is unsuitable for the vector.
